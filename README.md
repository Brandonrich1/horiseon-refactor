i went ahead and changed the html to symantic and spaced it out and organized it better. consolidated some css as much as i could without messing it up. this is important because it improves the company's website aswell as makes the code easier to read and more concise. i did some trouble with some of the code and with this assignment. i found it quite difficult.
